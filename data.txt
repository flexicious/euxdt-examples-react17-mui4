New York, March 08, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to Aa3 from A1. As of May 31, 2022, the district had about $1.8 million in outstanding GOULT debt.







RATINGS RATIONALE







The upgrade to Aa3 reflects the district's recent increases in operating fund balance that are high compared to similarly rated peers. We expect operating fund balance to remain strong due to increases in property tax collection and ambulance fees. The rating also incorporates the district's elevated pension burden that has improved in the last year but will still require increased contributions over the long-term. Finally, the rating considers the district's low debt and economic ties to the Chicago (Baa3 stable) metro area supporting the district's strong resident incomes and tax base. 







RATING OUTLOOK







Moody's does not typically assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt outstanding.







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Moderation of the pension burden







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Material declines in operating fund balance and liquidity












LEGAL SECURITY







The GOULT bonds are secured by a pledge of all legally available funds with authority to raise property taxes without limitation as to rate or amount to pay debt service.







PROFILE







The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods, Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).







METHODOLOGY







The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Special Purpose District General Obligation Debt Methodology published in November 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/394972. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

New York, April 05, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to A1 from Aa3. The district has $2.2 million in Moody's rated GOULT debt outstanding.










RATINGS RATIONALE










The downgrade to A1 reflects the fire district's elevated and growing pension burden. While reserves are currently healthy, rising fixed costs to service pensions is a long-term challenge. The rating also incorporates a large and wealthy tax base in the Chicago (Ba1 negative) metropolitan area, and a low direct debt burden.










RATING OUTLOOK










Moody's does not usually assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt.










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Moderation of the pension burden





- Significant revenue and reserve growth that provide additional budgetary flexibility










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Significant declines in operating reserves





- Large increase in debt or pension burdens










LEGAL SECURITY










The GOULT bonds are secured by the district's pledge of all legally available revenue with authority to raise property taxes unlimited as to rate or amount to pay debt service.










PROFILE










The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods (Aa3), Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).










METHODOLOGY 










The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Local Government General Obligation Debt published in January 2021 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBM_1260094.

New York, April 05, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to A1 from Aa3. The district has $2.2 million in Moody's rated GOULT debt outstanding.










RATINGS RATIONALE










The downgrade to A1 reflects the fire district's elevated and growing pension burden. While reserves are currently healthy, rising fixed costs to service pensions is a long-term challenge. The rating also incorporates a large and wealthy tax base in the Chicago (Ba1 negative) metropolitan area, and a low direct debt burden.










RATING OUTLOOK










Moody's does not usually assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt.










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Moderation of the pension burden





- Significant revenue and reserve growth that provide additional budgetary flexibility










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Significant declines in operating reserves





- Large increase in debt or pension burdens










LEGAL SECURITY










The GOULT bonds are secured by the district's pledge of all legally available revenue with authority to raise property taxes unlimited as to rate or amount to pay debt service.










PROFILE










The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods (Aa3), Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).










METHODOLOGY 










The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Local Government General Obligation Debt published in January 2021 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBM_1260094. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

New York, March 08, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to Aa3 from A1. As of May 31, 2022, the district had about $1.8 million in outstanding GOULT debt.







RATINGS RATIONALE







The upgrade to Aa3 reflects the district's recent increases in operating fund balance that are high compared to similarly rated peers. We expect operating fund balance to remain strong due to increases in property tax collection and ambulance fees. The rating also incorporates the district's elevated pension burden that has improved in the last year but will still require increased contributions over the long-term. Finally, the rating considers the district's low debt and economic ties to the Chicago (Baa3 stable) metro area supporting the district's strong resident incomes and tax base. 







RATING OUTLOOK







Moody's does not typically assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt outstanding.







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Moderation of the pension burden







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Material declines in operating fund balance and liquidity












LEGAL SECURITY







The GOULT bonds are secured by a pledge of all legally available funds with authority to raise property taxes without limitation as to rate or amount to pay debt service.







PROFILE







The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods, Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).







METHODOLOGY







The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Special Purpose District General Obligation Debt Methodology published in November 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/394972. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

New York, April 05, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to A1 from Aa3. The district has $2.2 million in Moody's rated GOULT debt outstanding.










RATINGS RATIONALE










The downgrade to A1 reflects the fire district's elevated and growing pension burden. While reserves are currently healthy, rising fixed costs to service pensions is a long-term challenge. The rating also incorporates a large and wealthy tax base in the Chicago (Ba1 negative) metropolitan area, and a low direct debt burden.










RATING OUTLOOK










Moody's does not usually assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt.










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Moderation of the pension burden





- Significant revenue and reserve growth that provide additional budgetary flexibility










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Significant declines in operating reserves





- Large increase in debt or pension burdens










LEGAL SECURITY










The GOULT bonds are secured by the district's pledge of all legally available revenue with authority to raise property taxes unlimited as to rate or amount to pay debt service.










PROFILE










The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods (Aa3), Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).

New York, March 08, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to Aa3 from A1. As of May 31, 2022, the district had about $1.8 million in outstanding GOULT debt.







RATINGS RATIONALE







The upgrade to Aa3 reflects the district's recent increases in operating fund balance that are high compared to similarly rated peers. We expect operating fund balance to remain strong due to increases in property tax collection and ambulance fees. The rating also incorporates the district's elevated pension burden that has improved in the last year but will still require increased contributions over the long-term. Finally, the rating considers the district's low debt and economic ties to the Chicago (Baa3 stable) metro area supporting the district's strong resident incomes and tax base. 







RATING OUTLOOK







Moody's does not typically assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt outstanding.







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Moderation of the pension burden







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Material declines in operating fund balance and liquidity












LEGAL SECURITY







The GOULT bonds are secured by a pledge of all legally available funds with authority to raise property taxes without limitation as to rate or amount to pay debt service.







PROFILE







The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods, Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).







METHODOLOGY







The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Special Purpose District General Obligation Debt Methodology published in November 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/394972. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

New York, March 08, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to Aa3 from A1. As of May 31, 2022, the district had about $1.8 million in outstanding GOULT debt.







RATINGS RATIONALE







The upgrade to Aa3 reflects the district's recent increases in operating fund balance that are high compared to similarly rated peers. We expect operating fund balance to remain strong due to increases in property tax collection and ambulance fees. The rating also incorporates the district's elevated pension burden that has improved in the last year but will still require increased contributions over the long-term. Finally, the rating considers the district's low debt and economic ties to the Chicago (Baa3 stable) metro area supporting the district's strong resident incomes and tax base. 







RATING OUTLOOK







Moody's does not typically assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt outstanding.







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Moderation of the pension burden







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Material declines in operating fund balance and liquidity












LEGAL SECURITY







The GOULT bonds are secured by a pledge of all legally available funds with authority to raise property taxes without limitation as to rate or amount to pay debt service.







PROFILE







The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods, Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).







METHODOLOGY







The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Special Purpose District General Obligation Debt Methodology published in November 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/394972. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

New York, April 05, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to A1 from Aa3. The district has $2.2 million in Moody's rated GOULT debt outstanding.










RATINGS RATIONALE










The downgrade to A1 reflects the fire district's elevated and growing pension burden. While reserves are currently healthy, rising fixed costs to service pensions is a long-term challenge. The rating also incorporates a large and wealthy tax base in the Chicago (Ba1 negative) metropolitan area, and a low direct debt burden.










RATING OUTLOOK










Moody's does not usually assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt.










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Moderation of the pension burden





- Significant revenue and reserve growth that provide additional budgetary flexibility










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Significant declines in operating reserves





- Large increase in debt or pension burdens










LEGAL SECURITY










The GOULT bonds are secured by the district's pledge of all legally available revenue with authority to raise property taxes unlimited as to rate or amount to pay debt service.










PROFILE










The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods (Aa3), Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).










METHODOLOGY 










The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Local Government General Obligation Debt published in January 2021 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBM_1260094. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

New York, March 08, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to Aa3 from A1. As of May 31, 2022, the district had about $1.8 million in outstanding GOULT debt.







RATINGS RATIONALE







The upgrade to Aa3 reflects the district's recent increases in operating fund balance that are high compared to similarly rated peers. We expect operating fund balance to remain strong due to increases in property tax collection and ambulance fees. The rating also incorporates the district's elevated pension burden that has improved in the last year but will still require increased contributions over the long-term. Finally, the rating considers the district's low debt and economic ties to the Chicago (Baa3 stable) metro area supporting the district's strong resident incomes and tax base. 







RATING OUTLOOK







Moody's does not typically assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt outstanding.







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Moderation of the pension burden







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Material declines in operating fund balance and liquidity












LEGAL SECURITY







The GOULT bonds are secured by a pledge of all legally available funds with authority to raise property taxes without limitation as to rate or amount to pay debt service.







PROFILE







The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods, Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).

New York, April 05, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to A1 from Aa3. The district has $2.2 million in Moody's rated GOULT debt outstanding.










RATINGS RATIONALE










The downgrade to A1 reflects the fire district's elevated and growing pension burden. While reserves are currently healthy, rising fixed costs to service pensions is a long-term challenge. The rating also incorporates a large and wealthy tax base in the Chicago (Ba1 negative) metropolitan area, and a low direct debt burden.










RATING OUTLOOK










Moody's does not usually assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt.










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Moderation of the pension burden





- Significant revenue and reserve growth that provide additional budgetary flexibility










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Significant declines in operating reserves





- Large increase in debt or pension burdens










LEGAL SECURITY










The GOULT bonds are secured by the district's pledge of all legally available revenue with authority to raise property taxes unlimited as to rate or amount to pay debt service.










PROFILE










The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods (Aa3), Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).

New York, April 05, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to A1 from Aa3. The district has $2.2 million in Moody's rated GOULT debt outstanding.










RATINGS RATIONALE










The downgrade to A1 reflects the fire district's elevated and growing pension burden. While reserves are currently healthy, rising fixed costs to service pensions is a long-term challenge. The rating also incorporates a large and wealthy tax base in the Chicago (Ba1 negative) metropolitan area, and a low direct debt burden.










RATING OUTLOOK










Moody's does not usually assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt.










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Moderation of the pension burden





- Significant revenue and reserve growth that provide additional budgetary flexibility










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Significant declines in operating reserves





- Large increase in debt or pension burdens










LEGAL SECURITY










The GOULT bonds are secured by the district's pledge of all legally available revenue with authority to raise property taxes unlimited as to rate or amount to pay debt service.










PROFILE










The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods (Aa3), Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).










METHODOLOGY 










The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Local Government General Obligation Debt published in January 2021 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBM_1260094. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

New York, March 08, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to Aa3 from A1. As of May 31, 2022, the district had about $1.8 million in outstanding GOULT debt.







RATINGS RATIONALE







The upgrade to Aa3 reflects the district's recent increases in operating fund balance that are high compared to similarly rated peers. We expect operating fund balance to remain strong due to increases in property tax collection and ambulance fees. The rating also incorporates the district's elevated pension burden that has improved in the last year but will still require increased contributions over the long-term. Finally, the rating considers the district's low debt and economic ties to the Chicago (Baa3 stable) metro area supporting the district's strong resident incomes and tax base. 







RATING OUTLOOK







Moody's does not typically assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt outstanding.







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Moderation of the pension burden







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Material declines in operating fund balance and liquidity












LEGAL SECURITY







The GOULT bonds are secured by a pledge of all legally available funds with authority to raise property taxes without limitation as to rate or amount to pay debt service.







PROFILE







The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods, Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).







METHODOLOGY







The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Special Purpose District General Obligation Debt Methodology published in November 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/394972. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

New York, March 08, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to Aa3 from A1. As of May 31, 2022, the district had about $1.8 million in outstanding GOULT debt.







RATINGS RATIONALE







The upgrade to Aa3 reflects the district's recent increases in operating fund balance that are high compared to similarly rated peers. We expect operating fund balance to remain strong due to increases in property tax collection and ambulance fees. The rating also incorporates the district's elevated pension burden that has improved in the last year but will still require increased contributions over the long-term. Finally, the rating considers the district's low debt and economic ties to the Chicago (Baa3 stable) metro area supporting the district's strong resident incomes and tax base. 







RATING OUTLOOK







Moody's does not typically assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt outstanding.







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Moderation of the pension burden







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Material declines in operating fund balance and liquidity












LEGAL SECURITY







The GOULT bonds are secured by a pledge of all legally available funds with authority to raise property taxes without limitation as to rate or amount to pay debt service.







PROFILE







The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods, Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).







METHODOLOGY







The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Special Purpose District General Obligation Debt Methodology published in November 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/394972. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

New York, April 05, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to A1 from Aa3. The district has $2.2 million in Moody's rated GOULT debt outstanding.










RATINGS RATIONALE










The downgrade to A1 reflects the fire district's elevated and growing pension burden. While reserves are currently healthy, rising fixed costs to service pensions is a long-term challenge. The rating also incorporates a large and wealthy tax base in the Chicago (Ba1 negative) metropolitan area, and a low direct debt burden.










RATING OUTLOOK










Moody's does not usually assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt.










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Moderation of the pension burden





- Significant revenue and reserve growth that provide additional budgetary flexibility










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Significant declines in operating reserves





- Large increase in debt or pension burdens










LEGAL SECURITY










The GOULT bonds are secured by the district's pledge of all legally available revenue with authority to raise property taxes unlimited as to rate or amount to pay debt service.










PROFILE










The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods (Aa3), Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).

New York, March 08, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to Aa3 from A1. As of May 31, 2022, the district had about $1.8 million in outstanding GOULT debt.







RATINGS RATIONALE







The upgrade to Aa3 reflects the district's recent increases in operating fund balance that are high compared to similarly rated peers. We expect operating fund balance to remain strong due to increases in property tax collection and ambulance fees. The rating also incorporates the district's elevated pension burden that has improved in the last year but will still require increased contributions over the long-term. Finally, the rating considers the district's low debt and economic ties to the Chicago (Baa3 stable) metro area supporting the district's strong resident incomes and tax base. 







RATING OUTLOOK







Moody's does not typically assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt outstanding.







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Moderation of the pension burden







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Material declines in operating fund balance and liquidity












LEGAL SECURITY







The GOULT bonds are secured by a pledge of all legally available funds with authority to raise property taxes without limitation as to rate or amount to pay debt service.







PROFILE







The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods, Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).







METHODOLOGY







The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Special Purpose District General Obligation Debt Methodology published in November 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/394972. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

New York, April 05, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to A1 from Aa3. The district has $2.2 million in Moody's rated GOULT debt outstanding.










RATINGS RATIONALE










The downgrade to A1 reflects the fire district's elevated and growing pension burden. While reserves are currently healthy, rising fixed costs to service pensions is a long-term challenge. The rating also incorporates a large and wealthy tax base in the Chicago (Ba1 negative) metropolitan area, and a low direct debt burden.










RATING OUTLOOK










Moody's does not usually assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt.










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Moderation of the pension burden





- Significant revenue and reserve growth that provide additional budgetary flexibility










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Significant declines in operating reserves





- Large increase in debt or pension burdens










LEGAL SECURITY










The GOULT bonds are secured by the district's pledge of all legally available revenue with authority to raise property taxes unlimited as to rate or amount to pay debt service.










PROFILE










The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods (Aa3), Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).










METHODOLOGY 










The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Local Government General Obligation Debt published in January 2021 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBM_1260094.

Finally, the rating considers the district's low debt and economic ties to the Chicago (Baa3 stable) metro area supporting the district's strong resident incomes and tax base. 







RATING OUTLOOK







Moody's does not typically assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt outstanding.







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Moderation of the pension burden







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Material declines in operating fund balance and liquidity












LEGAL SECURITY







The GOULT bonds are secured by a pledge of all legally available funds with authority to raise property taxes without limitation as to rate or amount to pay debt service.

New York, April 05, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to A1 from Aa3. The district has $2.2 million in Moody's rated GOULT debt outstanding.










RATINGS RATIONALE










The downgrade to A1 reflects the fire district's elevated and growing pension burden. While reserves are currently healthy, rising fixed costs to service pensions is a long-term challenge. The rating also incorporates a large and wealthy tax base in the Chicago (Ba1 negative) metropolitan area, and a low direct debt burden.










RATING OUTLOOK










Moody's does not usually assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt.










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Moderation of the pension burden





- Significant revenue and reserve growth that provide additional budgetary flexibility










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Significant declines in operating reserves





- Large increase in debt or pension burdens










LEGAL SECURITY










The GOULT bonds are secured by the district's pledge of all legally available revenue with authority to raise property taxes unlimited as to rate or amount to pay debt service.










PROFILE










The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods (Aa3), Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).

New York, March 08, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to Aa3 from A1. As of May 31, 2022, the district had about $1.8 million in outstanding GOULT debt.







RATINGS RATIONALE







The upgrade to Aa3 reflects the district's recent increases in operating fund balance that are high compared to similarly rated peers. We expect operating fund balance to remain strong due to increases in property tax collection and ambulance fees. The rating also incorporates the district's elevated pension burden that has improved in the last year but will still require increased contributions over the long-term. Finally, the rating considers the district's low debt and economic ties to the Chicago (Baa3 stable) metro area supporting the district's strong resident incomes and tax base. 







RATING OUTLOOK







Moody's does not typically assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt outstanding.







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Moderation of the pension burden







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Material declines in operating fund balance and liquidity












LEGAL SECURITY







The GOULT bonds are secured by a pledge of all legally available funds with authority to raise property taxes without limitation as to rate or amount to pay debt service.







PROFILE







The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods, Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).

New York, April 05, 2021 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to A1 from Aa3. The district has $2.2 million in Moody's rated GOULT debt outstanding.










RATINGS RATIONALE










The downgrade to A1 reflects the fire district's elevated and growing pension burden. While reserves are currently healthy, rising fixed costs to service pensions is a long-term challenge. The rating also incorporates a large and wealthy tax base in the Chicago (Ba1 negative) metropolitan area, and a low direct debt burden.










RATING OUTLOOK










Moody's does not usually assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt.










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Moderation of the pension burden





- Significant revenue and reserve growth that provide additional budgetary flexibility










FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS 










- Significant declines in operating reserves





- Large increase in debt or pension burdens










LEGAL SECURITY










The GOULT bonds are secured by the district's pledge of all legally available revenue with authority to raise property taxes unlimited as to rate or amount to pay debt service.










PROFILE










The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods (Aa3), Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).










METHODOLOGY 










The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Local Government General Obligation Debt published in January 2021 and available at https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBM_1260094. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.

New York, March 08, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has upgraded Countryside Fire Protection District, IL's general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) rating to Aa3 from A1. As of May 31, 2022, the district had about $1.8 million in outstanding GOULT debt.







RATINGS RATIONALE







The upgrade to Aa3 reflects the district's recent increases in operating fund balance that are high compared to similarly rated peers. We expect operating fund balance to remain strong due to increases in property tax collection and ambulance fees. The rating also incorporates the district's elevated pension burden that has improved in the last year but will still require increased contributions over the long-term. Finally, the rating considers the district's low debt and economic ties to the Chicago (Baa3 stable) metro area supporting the district's strong resident incomes and tax base. 







RATING OUTLOOK







Moody's does not typically assign outlooks to local governments with this amount of debt outstanding.







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Moderation of the pension burden







FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS







-     Material declines in operating fund balance and liquidity












LEGAL SECURITY







The GOULT bonds are secured by a pledge of all legally available funds with authority to raise property taxes without limitation as to rate or amount to pay debt service.







PROFILE







The Countryside Fire Protection District provides fire protection and emergency medical services to more than 35,000 residents primarily in Vernon Hills (Aaa), Long Grove, Hawthorn Woods, Indian Creek, and Kildeer (Aaa stable). The district was initially established in 1939 and now covers over 24 square miles of Lake County, IL (Aaa).







METHODOLOGY







The principal methodology used in these ratings was US Special Purpose District General Obligation Debt Methodology published in November 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/api/rmc-documents/394972. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.
